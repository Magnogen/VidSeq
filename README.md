###### A *Vid*eo *Seq*uencing language https://magnogen.net/VidSeq

VidSeq is a programming language I'm (very badly) working on, to help with the creation of videos.

It produces outputs that can be similar in style to a host of YouTubers, including:
- [TodePond](https://www.youtube.com/c/TodePond)
- [3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)
- [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/c/SebastianLague)

And a fair few others. If you don't know who these people are, I'd highly recommend checking them out as they can be a great source of inspiration (as evidenced by this project!)

## How it works

Idk yet, I'm figuring this out in the issues lol
